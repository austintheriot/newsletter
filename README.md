## About

This repo is my implementation of Luca Palmieri's newsletter demo API found in his book *Zero to Production in Rust*. My hope with this repo is to create a demo backend application that mirrors a "real-world" app as close as possible: CI/CD, automated testing, documentation, telemetry, etc.
