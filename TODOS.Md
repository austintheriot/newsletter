# TODOs

- Send traces to a dedicated service that implements OpenTelemetry such as Jaeger or Honeycomb (Honeycomb has a generous free tier & Jaeger is freeish, since it can be self-hosted) (see p. 131)

- Get containerized server running with containerized database locally using Docker compose or other options (see p. 147)
